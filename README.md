# ReSolve

### DISCLAIMER: THIS TOOL DOES NOT GUARANTEE GOOD BUILDS. 
#### AT BEST, IT CAN ONLY PROVIDE SUGGESTIONS FOR PLAYERS
#### For actual good builds, please make your own builds <3

Solving for all your Wynn build needs! ReSolve aims to recommend a player with items based on the partial build they inputted!

ReSolve is not: Wynnbuilder or WynnData

ReSolve is: Just a thing I made because I am bored, and would want to have some more experiences making stuff.

ReSolve will be: Wynnbuilder, soon enough. /s

# Features:
### The second fastest builder:

Just lags behind WynnBuilder (blame python), ReSolve takes pride on its incredible load speed to aid players in building (despite it is not even web-based what the hell).

### Build recommendation:

(the base builder is not even finished, soon:tm:)
